  category: Design
  description: Mags UK is the official source for back issues of magazines for many of the top UK magazine publishers. The brief was to replace the custom website which was dated and unmaintainable and bring the site over to the Magento platform. The website had to have additional features within the system which enabled visitors have a better experience on site. Their existing website needed redesigning inline with the additional extensions and features which were put in place to improve customer usability. Throughout the design process it was paramount to constantly update the client and take in all of their feedback to give them a flawless finished website.
