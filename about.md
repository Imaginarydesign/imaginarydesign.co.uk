I’m Adam Koniuszewski, and I am designer/frond-end developer. I live in Manchester with my wife, Ruth, and my 2 daughters, Florence(4) and Magdalena(1). Ultimately, all of my work is all about helping businesses grow through design and code.

That means I spend my time designing (websites, web apps, branding materials), coding, responding to support requests and meeting clients.

### What hardware do you use?

At work I use a 27” iMac. At home I use 21” iMac and 13” MacBook Air. For testing and browsing on the move I use iPad 2 and iPhone 4s.

### And what software?

[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is my main web browser. I spend most of my time in the [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) editor, [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) for CLI utilities. I use git and [Github](https://github.com/)/[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) for code versioning and [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer/mac/) for Markdown formatting. 

I use [Feedly](http://feedly.com/) to keep up with blog posts.

At work I use [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) for project management. [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) for support tickets and [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) for time tracking. 

### What your typical day look like?

**5-6am**- Wake up and check my email and schedule for any fires that may need my immediate attention. Coffee. Catchup with new articles on websites I follow via Feedly. Head out to the office.

**7-8am**- Work on side projects, updates, fixes.

**7pm-8.30pm**- Dinner, family time, get the girls ready for bed.

**9pm-10pm**- Down time. Watch coupe episodes of Family Guy or something on Netflix.
