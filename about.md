I’m Adam, a designer/frond-end dev from Manchester.

I love a challenge; the more complex the better. For me there is nothing more rewarding than taking a complicated problem, breaking it down and delivering a beautifully simple solution.

With many years of experience both in an agency environment and as a self employed freelancer, I have designed, developed and managed a wide range of web projects. This has been conducted in a variety of teams and environments from small websites for local businesses to multi million pound e-commerce websites.

Ultimately, all of my work is all about helping businesses grow through design and code. That means I spend my time designing (websites, web apps, branding materials), coding, responding to support requests and meeting clients.

I live in Manchester with my wife, Ruth, and my 2 daughters, Florence(5) and Magdalena(2). 

### What hardware do you use?

At work I use a 27” iMac. At home I use 21” iMac and 13” MacBook Air. For testing and browsing on the move I use iPad 2 and iPhone 4s.

### And what software?

[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is my main web browser. I spend most of my time in the [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) editor, [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) for CLI utilities. I use git and [Github](https://github.com/)/[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) for code versioning and [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer/mac/) for Markdown formatting. 

I use [Feedly](http://feedly.com/) to keep up with blog posts.

At work I use [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/)/Teamwork/Trello for project management. [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) for support tickets. [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) for time tracking and [Slack](https://slack.com/) for team messaging.

### The tech stuff
I regulary use the following: Git, Github/Bitbucket, PHP, JS, Bower, Gulp, Vue.js, React.js, Laravel, npm/yarn, Blade etc.
