Nathan Kontny, Founder of two YC companies: Inkling and Cityposh, shares his method to validate startup ideas:

> When people tell me about their idea today, I generally start with just a few questions: Are you teaching anyone who looks like someone who would buy what you intend on selling? If not, why not? Why don’t you start a blog today targeting a typical customer and start posting 500 words every three days?
> 
> You want to create a business around innovating the sale of diapers? Start blogging to new parents tips on changing diapers, how to deal with diaper rash, or even about saving for education.
