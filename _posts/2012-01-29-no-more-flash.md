&#8220;Flash is the special plugin that everyone has to install to be able to see your content. No it’s not enough that there are many ways to show your visitors content without requiring them to install extra plugins in their browser. It’s not enough that the browsers today have very good support for all kinds of cool effects and code.

Let’s look at an analogy of what flash really is. Just imagine if you could not pick up books and read them unless you also had a special pair of glasses. I know some people always have to wear glasses.

But this special pair of glasses would still be necessary on top of their usual ones. And everybody in the world who opened a book without these special glasses would only see the message “this book cannot be read without special glasses. Get your pair free today!” Of course everyone would find this annoying.

And a lot of people would go out and get their special glasses. And once in a while, the glasses would stop working until you got a new pair, so there was a constant going back to get a new pair of glasses or else you would not be able to read any books. But thankfully, someone was so annoyed with this whole process that they designed books that could be read without special glasses.

Of course the books would not look just like the ones you were used to. Maybe they all the page borders didn’t have animated stuff going on (which you found really distracting anyway). But overall, you found it so nice to not have to use special glasses to read them, you would start reading those books instead of the old ones.&#8221;
