Justin Jackson, Product Manager for a profitable web app, and the host of the [Product People](http://productpeople.tv/):

> You have something in your head, something you&#8217;d like to do. You think about it all the time, but you haven&#8217;t done anything about it.
> 
> 
> 
> Instead, you procrastinate by reading: blog posts, books, tutorials. You read the [4-Hour Workweek](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/) and _dreamt_ but never _did_. You got inspired but your inspiration died on the vine.
> 
> Why?
> 
> Why can&#8217;t you get your engine running? Laziness? Fear? Too busy?
> 
> You drive to the office dreading your day, but you drive home with a dream&#8230; &#8220;One day I&#8217;m going to build a startup. One day I&#8217;m going to finish that side-project. One day I&#8217;m going to launch that thing.&#8221;
> 
> But that one day never comes.
