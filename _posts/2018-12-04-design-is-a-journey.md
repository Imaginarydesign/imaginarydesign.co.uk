My last 15 years working as designer have been about helping clients get from A to B, using design as a vehicle for this journeys. 

For me personally, “the vehicle” has been less important than the journey itself.

Most of the time “the vehicle” was dirty and temperamental. Sometimes the engine refused to work, and other is needed a jump start. Sometimes we ran out of fuel. 

But in the end we got to our destinations. 

I have made many journeys in my career as a designer. I have seen many people trying to revive a stalled car.

The hard part is not the first pixel, nor the last, but everything in between. 

The undiscovered, less-travelled tracks present challenges. 

That’s where we discover ourselves the most.
