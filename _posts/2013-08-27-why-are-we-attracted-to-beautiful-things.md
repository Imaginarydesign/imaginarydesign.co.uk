Divya Pahwa, author for ooomph.com on &#8220;Why are we attracted to beautiful things?&#8221;:

> I remember ridiculously well, I was 14 and my brother ordered his first Apple product (an iPod touch) and immediately called up two of his closest friends. He was inviting them over so they could watch him _open _the package. The three of them sat around mesmerised, by the beauty of the box and the way everything fit just so perfectly. They analysed and commented, my brother removed layers of black plastic and small white instruction booklets. They were in absolute reverence at the beauty of the box and (of, course) the perfectly proportioned product.
> 
> Why did this box and this specific product garner such a reaction? What made it beautiful?
