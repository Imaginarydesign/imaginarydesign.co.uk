If I could fix one problem across the majority of the clients that I work with, it would be their inability to prioritise.

It amazes me that this piece of common sense adviceÂ [has spread so far](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22Offend%20nobody%2C%20design%20for%20somebody%22). Why has it resonated so much? I believe it is because it highlights the importance of prioritisation. You cannot and should not be all things to all people.

With limited time, attention and resources you have to prioritise. There is no choice. You cannot focus on all your business objectives and meet the needs of all of your diverse audiences without spreading yourself impossibly thin.
