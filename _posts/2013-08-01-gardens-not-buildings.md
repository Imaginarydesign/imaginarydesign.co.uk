&#8220;Great projects start out feeling like buildings. There are architects, materials, staff, rigid timelines, permits, engineers, a structure.

It works or it doesn&#8217;t.

Build something that doesn&#8217;t fall down. On time.

But in fact, great projects, like great careers and relationships that last, are gardens. They are tended, they shift, they grow. They endure over time, gaining a personality and reflecting their environment. When something dies or fades away, we prune, replant and grow again.

Perfection and polish aren&#8217;t nearly as important as good light, good drainage and a passionate gardener.

By all means, build. But don&#8217;t finish. Don&#8217;t walk away.&#8221;
