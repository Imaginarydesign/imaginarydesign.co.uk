Jamie Kosoy from [Arbitrary](http://arbitrary.io/ "Arbitrary") and Dan Mall from [SuperFriendly](http://superfriend.ly/) decided that they want to build an app together. They&#8217;ve also decided to work entirely [in public](http://chriscoyier.net/2012/09/23/working-in-public/ "Work in public"):

> We’ll try to document as much as we can. All of our discussions will be recorded and broadcast through Google Hangout. We’ll post every email, IM conversation, Basecamp post, or whatever that we make. We’ll likely change directions often. We’ll probably argue too. This will be incredibly raw: no editing whatsoever. This will not be for the faint of heart.

What a great idea. They don’t even know if they’ll make it to the finish line, but that doesn&#8217;t matter. The journey will be extremely interesting.
