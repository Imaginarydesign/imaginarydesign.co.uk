Great restaurants don’t simply sell food. They sell an experience. 

From how the restaurant welcomes new customers to interior design, music selection, perfumes wafting from dimly-lit candles, interactions with the waiters and waitresses. 

How the dish looks on the table, how it tastes. Turnaround time, waiting time. The ease of collecting a jacket from the cloakroom. 

Food is only a part of it. The chef is only a part of it. 

In its entirety, this is user experience.
