&#8220;All of the work we do as creatives use the abilities we have to play with emotion. To make someone laugh is to be memorable. To scare someone is to be unforgettable. To make someone’s day easier is to be seen as positive.

We have this ability because we are communicators. We know the tricks to attract the masses. We know what’s effective. We have a sense that we develop to be able to distinguish what is and what isn’t engaging. If we aren’t able to do that, then graphic designers we are not.

We create emotion

So why isn’t it done more often? Why is it that so much of the work we see is flat, emotionless shells of style?

Often what we see is boring. It’s a style wrapped in a technique, with barely a seed of an idea. The client—or the designer—doesn’t understand what they’re trying to communicate, they just know that they need to be communicating something.

Forget how good something looks. Aesthetics come second. They’re 80% of our game, but the remaining 20% holds more importance. If there isn’t an idea, if there isn’t a trigger for an emotional change, then it doesn’t matter how aesthetically pleasing a piece of work is — it’s ultimately worthless. When the winds of style pull in another direction, the piece will become more than ugly — it’ll become useless.

Before you think of the style your next piece of work will be in, before you sit to sketch your thumbnails, ask yourself what is the reaction I want them to have when they see this?

From this discovered emotion will come the concept, from which the aesthetics will grow. It’s a simple fact, one you may not want to admit to yourself, but if what you’re designing is emotionally boring, then no one will care in a meaningful way. If they’re not engaged and feeling something—anything then you haven’t done your job as a communicator.&#8221;
