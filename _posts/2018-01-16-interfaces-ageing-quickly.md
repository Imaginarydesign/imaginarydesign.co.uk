Nothing stays still in the digital age. Interfaces are not meant to be admired. They are meant to be scrolled though, used, read, shared, interacted with, copied, discussed. 

The amateur obsession with a perfect visual interface is irrelevant. 

Interfaces are not meant to be still. They are in motion. All the time. 

Interfaces are ageing very quickly.
