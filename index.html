      <p>I have been working as a lead designer and front end developer since 2004. With many years of experience both in an agency environment and as a self employed freelancer, I have designed, developed and managed a wide range of web projects, from small websites for local businesses to multi million pound e-commerce applications.</p>
      <p>I love a challenge; the more complex the better. For me there is nothing more rewarding than taking a complicated problem, breaking it down and delivering a beautifully simple solution.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, all of my work is all about helping businesses bring their digital product & service ideas to life. I help business owners improve the digital experience of their users and help them adapt to the ever-changing digital landscape. I’m passionate about creating simple, digital experiences that make people’s lives better.</p>

      <p>I could have shown you here some “pretty examples” of the past projects that I have worked on but I've realised that they might be irrelevant to you (they are solutions to somebody’s else problem). I love making beautiful visuals but it’s not what drives me (feel free to have a sneak peek at what I’m currently working on <a href="https://dribbble.com/ImaginaryDesign" target="_blank">here</a> ). What drives me is underlying user needs. I want to create something that actually solves their problems. You can read about how I work here.</p>
      <p>I like to believe that the work I do makes a difference to both individuals and businesses in a variety of industries. I work with people who aren’t afraid of new ideas but more importantly, believe in them and want to make them happen.</p>
      <p>Back in the day I thought I am going to be an artist. I was quite good at it (I even had a few exhibitions and won few awards for it) but now I’m just <a href="/art">mediocre</a>.</p>
