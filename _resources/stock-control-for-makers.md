After watching my wife dealing with various order notes/receipts/invoices while running her ‘clothing’ business, I think I can help.

<img src="/assets/images/resources/stock-control.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Web Designer's checklist">

I am trying to design an app to help small "handmade/craft" businesses.

Initial idea is to centralise orders so if you sell on multiple platforms (IG, Etsy, Website) you will be able to see them in one place and in the correct order. I also want to add in stock management features and possibly things like the ability to invoice.

To help me on my way please could you take a few minutes to fill in a questionnaire?
