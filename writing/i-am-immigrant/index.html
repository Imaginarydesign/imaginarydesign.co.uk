It was also the year I graduated from university after studying design for six years.</p><p>It was also the year my mum passed away after battling a long-term illness.</p><p>Lots of questions spiralled in my head, desperately looking for answers. I was trying to figure out what’s going on.</p><p>I decided to make a new, fresh start. Again.</p><p>I needed a new challenge. Something to help me stop thinking about the past.</p><p>I decided I want to move to another country. To run away as far as I could from my problems, but I didn’t know to where.</p><p>Eventually I was in England. It could as well have been France or Spain or Germany, but here I was in England.</p><p>I left my past behind me. I left my friends. The place I was born. The place I went to school. The place where I grew up. The place I had my first kiss.</p><p>Just me and one suitcase.</p><p>New country, new language, new people, new challenge. I felt like a medieval explorer boarding a ship heading for the unknown. Beyond the horizon lay a place I knew nothing about.</p><p>While this was not an easy decision, it did not take me long to make. I saved the amount of money I though I would need. I made some basic preparations. I bought an ‘Everyday English’ phrasebook. I hardly spoke English.</p><p>I boarded the plane from Wroclaw and landed in Liverpool. My final destination was Manchester. I gave myself two weeks—learn to swim or drown.</p><p>I had one point of contact in Manchester, a friend of a friend who promised to help me find a place to stay when I arrived until I found more permanent housing. I texted the mutual friend when I got off the plane in Liverpool to let her know where I was and told her I would update her on my journey.</p><p>There was no response. She must be busy, I thought.</p><p>I boarded a coach from Liverpool to Manchester. Texted her again. No reply. I started to worry.</p><p>The coach arrived to Manchester late that evening. Dark and raining, I could see people heading to bars and restaurants for after work meals. This new place excited me and made me anxious at the same time. I texted my friend again. I wasn’t sure where to go. Again, there was no reply.</p><p>I never heard anything from her. Lots of things have happened since.</p><p>In Manchester I met my wife, Ruth. We got married in 2011 in York. We bought a house. We have two daughters. Florence is 7, Magda is 3. I’ve changed jobs a few times.</p><p>And sometimes, I still wonder what happened.</p><p></p><hr style="margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 40px"><small>Still reading?</small><h2><a href="/writing/web-agencies-are-like-restaurants/">Web design agencies are like restaurants</a></h2><p></p></div></div></div><div class="footer-minimal"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"><div class="footer-links"><ul class="list-inline"><li><a href="/writing">Writing</a></li><li><a href="https://dribbble.com/ImaginaryDesign" target="_blank">Dribbble</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/imaginarydesign/" target="_blank">Instagram</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/ImaginaryDesign" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/Imaginarydesign" target="_blank">Github</a></li><li><a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/koniuszewski" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><script src="/assets/js/aos.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/main.min.js?ver=dc1fb10a0b"></script></body></html>
